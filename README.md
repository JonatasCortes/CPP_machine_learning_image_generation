# CPP_machine_learning_image_generation
The objective of this project is to replicate the algorithm implemented in  https://github.com/SebastianCharmot/Genetic-Algorithm-Image-Recreation with c++, with the most basic image processing library, and maybe solve the asymptote issue the original creators of the algorithm encountered.
